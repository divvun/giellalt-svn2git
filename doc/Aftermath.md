# Aftermath

To be fleshed out, but the following points are at least relevant:

* transfer bugzilla issues to github issues (only open ones, or old ones too?)
    * see [this project](https://github.com/orgs/giellalt/projects/4)
* transfer dictionaries to github - repo prefix `dict-`
* possibly transfer other stuff to github:
	* tools
	* techdoc (`site-giellalt`?)
	* the other sites, repo prefix `site-`?
	* make the site build and publish on push/commit using github actions

## DONE tasks

* set up branches according to git-flow and our needs
	* partially DONE, to be further evaluated
* set up CI for the various integration branches
	* partially DONE, ongoing work
* make sure everything is working also for svn users
	* DONE (at least svn ignore, everything else works as before)
* define production languages - DONE
