# Aftermath

To be fleshed out, but the following points are at least relevant:

* transfer bugzilla issues to github issues (only open ones, or old ones too?)
* set up branches according to git-flow and our needs
* set up CI for the various integration branches
* make sure everything is working also for svn users
* define production languages etc
